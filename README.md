# AI-Final
The final project for an AI class, made by a friend and I. 


AI mechanics included are:

Flocking 				= Small dragons that fly over the player, for aesthetic. 

Chase					= The knight chases the player on sight, and then goes back to his position to guard once the player leaves his area. 

Perlin Noise			= Ghost doesn't attack, but hurts on contact. Random movement. 

Finite State Machine	= The axe fighter chases the player on sight. When the player leaves the area, he patrols his room. 

Interception		= The bat will spawn at one of the 4 corners of the map, and then attempt to intercept the player and crash into him. 


The player controls a character as they try to escape the maze and fight off monsters within. 
Music, SFX and animations are included.
